Note that there is no main.py in here.  There are several programs that can be run and worked on.
In order to run a program from VSCode, open the Run Menu and choose Open Configurations.  Then,
change the name of the program to the one that you are working on.  For example:

"program": "/home/robot/${workspaceRootFolderName}/EV3SoccerArcade.py",

main.py has been removed.  When working on this code, you should work on the actual python
file you are interested in.  Note that all of the programs are available to be run
on the brick by browsing the filesystem and choosing one of the .py files.
